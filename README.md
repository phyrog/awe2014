=======

Repository for AWE (agile web development) 2014 at University Bremen using Ruby and Rails.

## Hangman
The hangman directory includes the first task to build a hangman program using ruby.

It includes only basic functionality without any highscore or settings (apart from the possibility to use a custom dictionary as a command line option).
