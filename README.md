=======

Repository for AWE (agile web development) 2014 at University Bremen using Ruby and Rails.

## Hangman
The hangman directory includes the first task to build a hangman program using ruby.

It includes only basic functionality without any highscore or settings (apart from the possibility to use a custom dictionary as a command line option).

## Roman
The roman directory includes the second task to program a library for roman numbers. The purpose was to get used to TDD (test driven development), so the roman_spec.rb file was written before the actual implementation.

Because the main task was to familiarize with rspec, the actual algorithm to convert an integer to the string representation (and the other way around) was taken from rosettacode.org ([here](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Roman_numerals/Decode#Ruby) and [here](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Roman_numerals/Encode#Ruby)).
